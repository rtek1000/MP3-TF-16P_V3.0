- 1: Avoid this model. Prefer other models such as the original DFPlayer Mini, MP3-TF-16P (other than V3.0), or try other models.
- 2: The module may crash when data is being sent and the microcontroller is reset or reprogrammed.
- 3: The RESET command does not work if the module is locked (see tip 2).
- 4: To unlock the module, reset the power (It may be necessary to use a transistor in the power supply).
